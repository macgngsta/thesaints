This will be my second project using Bootstrap as a framework for website development. 
The reason why I've gone in this direction instead of coding from scratch is because there will be a number of new things to be learned in this self lesson.   
<br>
Things that I would focus on include, but is not limited to: 

1.  Responsiveness for different mediums 
2.  Browser compabtility  
3.  Start to finish design with client including UI/UX  
4.  Learning to use Figma to provide design mock ups 
5.  Integrate some Bootstrap.js since I didn't do this the first time I tried BS.
